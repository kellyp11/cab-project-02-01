## Introduction
Welcome to our web application! This is a web application that will be developed with Flask and PostgreSQL.

## Goal
The user will be able to witness trends in data between the Natural Gas/Fuel Oil from our power plant and the power coming from our Electric grid. The user will be able to see the usage of such energy sources on a season by season basis to observe the fluctuations that may occur throughout the years. The user will also have access to a energy-efficiency analysis computed within the application.

## Usage
More to come soon!

## Build Process
More to come soon!
